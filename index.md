## About Us

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
    The Helbling Robotics Lab focuses on designing autonomous insect-scale robotic platforms that can perform sustained, intelligent operation in real-world environments. We focus on holistic design founded in both theory and experiments in which we co-design mechanisms, system architecture, and control with the final environment and task in mind. In the group, this work is divided into two main themes: (1) leveraging cm-scale physics to develop effective locomotion strategies at the insect-scale, and (2) overcoming challenges to design and integrate mm-scale perception, power, and control systems.

We are a part of the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu). 

We are looking to expand our team. If you've read our reasearch and are looking to join us, [click here](efh45@cornell.edu).

Feel free to stop by our lab in Phillips 328 to see our robots in action!
